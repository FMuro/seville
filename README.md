## Seville LaTeX beamer theme 

![Showcase](demo/demo.gif)

Do you like this? Have a look at the [PDF](demo/demo.pdf) and the [LaTeX code](demo/demo.tex).

## How to use

Copy `beamerthemeseville.sty` to your beamer presentation's folder, add

```
\usetheme{seville}
```

to the preamble, and compile with **LuaLaTeX**.

If you're going to use it often, you can place `beamerthemeseville.sty` somewhere in your TeX distribution tree instead. 

## Acknowledgements

This theme is inspired Matthias Vogelgesang's beautiful [Metropolis theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme/). It uses Google's [Noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto), the [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color palette, icons by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), and a lovely logo by [Graficatessen](https://graficatessen.es/), along with many other FOSS things. I'm grateful to all creators that make this possible.

## Why this theme?

The Metropolis theme is unfortunately unmaintained. Changes in its dependencies have caused glitches. Seville is extremely simple. It is therefore easy to maintain although it has way less options. Seville is probably a drop-in replacement for people that was using Metropolis without tweaking too much.

I've also added some goodies for mathematicians and academics in general.
